# My Showboat

## Description

This is a website for preparing votes that will be delivered at some events. A scheduled party may have some competition where the winner is voted by all competitors. Then the host may use this site to prepare the event and execute the vote when the competition is finished. Every participant can join the vote very easily introducing the vote code and see the results instantly through a projector or TV.

The party is recorded so the host can view again the results and every vote submitted at any point.
